<b>Focus: </b>âˆ†Immutable, decentralized event sourcing using a lightweight cryptographic ledger (blockchain-like).

<b>Core Problem Solved: </b>

Provides a tamper-proof source of truth for application state in microservices or federated systems. By chaining domain events with cryptographic hashes, it ensures the integrity of the business logic history (the "Event Stream"). This is critical for auditing, complex state reconstruction, and compliance in finance or healthcare.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python): </b>

A simplified implementation of a Block/Ledger structure where each event (block) cryptographically references the previous event's hash, creating an immutable chain.
